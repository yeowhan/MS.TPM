Food Truck Project Proposal



Problem

The team has a passion for discovering new places to eat and love variety.  Many other employees may also feel the need for a variety in food consumption throughout the work week.  The cafeteria may not have what employees desire for that given time or day.  The cafeteria may also run out of certain items that is no longer in stock.  Employees may also not want a full meal, but rather other means of satisfying their hunger.  Unfortunately, the vending machines are not what the employees want with both snacks or drinks choices.  Also, fast food may not be the smart choice and do not have time and money for restaurants.  Many, may feel the need for “something else.”  Through taste testing, the team has a particular affection for food trucks.  In San Francisco, the city has a published a food truck open dataset, but it is not easily consumable or searchable on devices.

Proposed Solution

Introducing the proposal to introduce an online application that will provide at least five different variety food trucks that are currently open for business within the user’s specific location using San Francisco’s food truck open dataset!  Providing an online application to employees will not only save time, but is most convenient as most employees have access to the internet.  This will give employees a variety of food truck availability and selections.  They can choose from the results that will best suit their needs.  If the employee is in a hurry, they can choose the food truck that is nearest to their location.  If the employee has time, in between meetings, they can choose what best fit his/her taste buds.  Employees will be able to pick and choose what best fits their needs, which can lead to better productivity.  If the online application is successful, feedback from users can produce further enhancements to improve upon this product!
